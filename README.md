# Cross-Linguistic Patterns of Body–Object Colexification in Indo-European and Uralic Languages

### Overviews
This repository contains the code and analysis for a research project investigating how different language families colexify human body parts and object concepts. By comparing Indo-European and Uralic languages, the project explores whether these families share universal semantic patterns or exhibit distinct conceptual structures.

The study uses the Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications (CLICS) and leverages statistical testing, and computational linguistics methods.
